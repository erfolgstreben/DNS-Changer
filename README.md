# ⚙️ DNS Changer

A simple Python utility to change your DNS servers on Windows. Changing your DNS can help hide the specific websites you visit (example: `github.com`, `youtube.com`) from your ISP while browsing the Internet. 
This tool allows you to quickly switch your DNS to either **Cloudflare** or **Google**, enhancing privacy and **potentially** improving browsing speed.

- Error handling to ensure proper execution.

## ⚡️ Notes

- Make sure to **run the Python script as administrator**, otherwise the DNS changes may fail.
